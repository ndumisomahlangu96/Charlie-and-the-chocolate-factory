                Every HTML element has a border, margin, and padding. These three terms <br>
                are important because the presentation generally somewhat depends on them.
            </p>

            <p>
                The border, margin, and padding is used for clarity and better looks. But <br>
                before moving the you need to understand the CSS box model.
            </p>

            <h1>CSS box model</h1>

            <p>
                The HTML elements are <b>enclosed inside a box.</b> This box is knowns as the <br>
                "CSS Box Model".
            </p>

            <p>
                This model has four parts: the border, margin, padding, and content. <b>By <br>
                default, only content is visible while the border is not and the the margin <br>
                 and padding are zero.</b>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The content can be text, image, etc.</li>
                <li>The content is surrounded by the border.</li>
                <li>The area between the content and the border is padding.</li>
                <li>The area outside the border is the margin.</li>
                <li>
                    The border can be visible, depends on the CSS. But margin and <br>
                    padding are invisible.
