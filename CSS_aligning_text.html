        <p>
            By default, the text is always aligned to the left side of the container. But <br>
            can also change the alignment using CSS.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The "text-align" property sets the horisontal alignment. It can have four <br>
            values: <b>left, right, and center.</b>
        </p>

            The first paragraph is aligned to the left, which is also the default alignment, <br>
            the second paragraph is aligned to the right, and the third one is aligned to the <br>
            center.
