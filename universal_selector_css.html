        <p style= "color : green">
            So far, we have discussed how to use the id selector for a particular element, <br>
            the class selector for multiple elements, and the grouping selector for the    <br>
            grouping different elements with the same definition. But what if we need the  <br>
            same CSS for every element in the HTML file? There is another selector         <br>
            called universal selector for such cases.

            <b style="color:blue">Use the asterisk (*) sign to apply CSS to every element.</b>
        </p>
