        <h1>class selector</h1>
        <p>
            The id is usually unique for an element. But what if we need the same CSS <br>
            for a group of elements? Not all, but some of them. Observe the following
        </p>

        </a>

        <p>This is a red paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a red paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a red paragraph.</p>

        <p>This is a red paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a red paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a red paragraph.</p>

        <p>
           Out of all the six paragraphs, first, three should be red in color. We can give <br>
           the same ids to them and it will work. But it is not recommended at all. For <br>
           such cases, we have another attribute, which is known as the "class" <br>
           attribute. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>The class selector is used to give the same CSS to multiple elements.</b> To <br>
            use this type of selector, use a dot(.) followed by the class name. <br>
            The same class is assigned for the first three tags.

        <style>
            .redp{
                color:red;
            }
        </style>

        <p class="redp">This is a red paragraph.</p>
        <p class="redp">This is a red paragraph.</p>
        <p class="redp">This is a red paragraph.</p>

        <p>This is a red paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a red paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a red paragraph.</p>

        <p>
            The CSS is applied to the first three paragraphs, while others are unaffected.
            Like id, <b> a class name can also not start with a number.</b>
